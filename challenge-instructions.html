<!-- HTML & CSS challenge
Now that you got some practice with HTML & CSS let's put those skills to use! We need you to recreate the pandora login found here.

We'll provide you with the basic HTML your job is turn it into the pandora login screen using primarily CSS (you are welcome to change the HTML, but you do not have to in order to complete this challenge)!

Here’s the HTML Code: -->

<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>New Webpage</title>
    <style>
    </style>
</head>
<body>
  <span class="header-bar">
    <span class="pandora">
      PANDORA
    </span>
    <span class="button-bar">
      <a href="">sign up</a>
      |
      <a href="">log in</a>
      |
      <a href="">help</a>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span class="main-caption">
    Free personalized radio that
    <br>
    plays the music you love
  </span>
  <form name="loginForm" submit="">
    <input type="email" placeholder="Email">
    <input type="password" placeholder="Password">
    <button class="login" type="submit">
      Log In
    </button>
  </form>
  <span class="checkbox">
    <label>
      <input type="checkbox">
    </label>
    <span>Keep me signed in</span>
   </span>
  <span class="forgot-pass">
    <a class="forgot-pass" href="">Forgot password?</a>
  </span>
</body>
</html>

Also with CSS there is an attribute called “display” and if you set it to the value of “block” that may be useful to you.
